**The supported version is 1.8.X -> 1.19.X**
_You also need to install ProtocolSupport.jar, Citizens-2.0.29-b2542.jar to make him happy and run!_

**You need to run on paper-1.18.2.jar**
_If not, it will have many more bugs and will not be able to analyze each player!_

# When will the updates come?
_Unfortunately, this project is made and continued by only one member of the SkyPixel Team. This project was abandoned for 5 years and has now been rebuilt. So the conclusion is that I will do my best to make as many updates as possible, but don't expect them to be fast._
